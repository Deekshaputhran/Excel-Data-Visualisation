The Sales Dashboard is a tool for analyzing sales data and making informed business decisions. By visualizing the profit gained by individual items, the top customers contributing to profits, and overall sales trends, it provides actionable insights that help in strategizing sales and marketing efforts. The dashboard is particularly useful for tracking monthly performance and understanding customer behavior, empowering businesses to focus on the most profitable areas of their operations.
